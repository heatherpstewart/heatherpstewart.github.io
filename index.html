				<p> I am studying computer science. I have no idea what I want to do or be in my life but I do know that I want to work from home. Computer science feels like a solid possibility for achieving that goal. Although, seeing how much AI can do is really giving me pause. Maybe I should reconsider becoming a famous reclusive artist. That happens, right?</p>
