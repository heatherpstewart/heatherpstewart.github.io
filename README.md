*This is my github account for learning github

*This specific repository is a class assignment

*To create this clone, I selected the clone option from the GitHub GUI. I decided to use the GUI instead of the CLI, thought that would have worked too. I edited this with VSC. I prefer VSC to other readme options. Then I saved my changes in order to be able to use the GUI to push them in the next phase. 

#About Me

##My Interests
I am **very** interested in: reading smut, herbalism, and staying out of the sun. Smut is _great_ because it is entertaining and gives me something to do as I avoid the _**burning rock in the sky**_. Herbalism is what I use to treat my precious ginger skin after I accidentally get burnt on the way to check my mail. Staying out of the sun is more an investment in my own happiness as I am not built to **suffer**.

##Interesting Facts
1. I was raised in a town that loved donkey basketball. [_Check it out_](https://www.coshoctontribune.com/story/news/local/2021/12/22/donkey-basketball-fundraiser-aids-river-view-families-teen-leadership-corps/8973069002/)
2. I am terrified of tornados because I have seen 8 within spitting distance.
3. I don't understand how I've seen so many tornados in my backyard growing up when my hometown, [**Taylorsville, NC**](http://www.usa.com/taylorsville-nc-natural-disasters-extremes.htm), isn't the worst for tornados.
