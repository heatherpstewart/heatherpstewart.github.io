*This is my github account for learning github

*This specific repository is a class assignment

*To create this clone, I selected the clone option from the GitHub GUI. I decided to use the GUI instead of the CLI, thought that would have worked too. I edited this with VSC. I prefer VSC to other readme options. Then I saved my changes in order to be able to use the GUI to push them in the next phase.
